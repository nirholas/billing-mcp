> A [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that lets an AI agent self-serve its **own** account economics over stdio: how much of its plan quota is left, what its metered usage rolled up to this period, the line-item invoice and per-charge receipts behind every charge, and the earnings its agents have made — all without pulling in the human account owner.

Every read hits the live three.ws billing API — nothing is mocked. The account-scoped reads run against the account **you own**, resolved from your three.ws session. This server is **read-only**: it surfaces private billing data but never signs, charges, or moves funds.

## Install

```bash
npm install @three-ws/billing-mcp
```

Or run with `npx` (no install):

```bash
npx @three-ws/billing-mcp
```

## Quick start

**Claude Code**, one line:

```bash
claude mcp add billing -- npx -y @three-ws/billing-mcp
```

**Claude Desktop / Cursor** (`claude_desktop_config.json` or `mcp.json`):

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"billing": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": ["-y", "@three-ws/billing-mcp"],
			"env": {
				"THREE_WS_SESSION": "<your __Host-sid cookie>"
			}
		}
	}
}
```

`THREE_WS_SESSION` is required for every read except the public fee rate — it's the value of the `__Host-sid` cookie from a signed-in three.ws browser session, and the API uses it to resolve your account and return only your data.

Inspect the surface with the MCP Inspector:

```bash
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/inspector npx @three-ws/billing-mcp
```

## Tools

| Tool                       | Type              | What it does                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `get_billing_summary`      | read · session    | Your plan tier, its quota ceilings, and live usage against them (avatars + storage, agents, MCP calls, LLM calls) + headroom. |
| `query_usage`              | read · session    | Metered usage rolled into an invoice statement for a period — per-action line items, totals, and reconciliation.            |
| `export_billing_history`   | read · session    | The same line items as a ready-to-save CSV payload (with a suggested filename and a parsed preview).                        |
| `get_receipt`              | read · session    | One itemized receipt — per-charge by `event_id` (with settlement tx + explorer link) or a signed skill-purchase receipt by `purchase_id`. |
| `get_revenue`              | read · session    | Earnings for the agents you own — gross/fee/net, per-skill and over time, plus creator-subscription income.                 |
| `get_fee_info`             | read · **public** | The current platform fee rate (`fee_bps` + `fee_percent`). Needs no session.                                                |

Everything reads live state — usage, invoices, and earnings all move between calls — so no tool is idempotent, and nothing here mutates anything.

### Input parameters

**`get_billing_summary`** — none.

**`query_usage`** — `period` (YYYY-MM, optional), `from` / `to` (ISO-8601, optional; ignored when `period` is set). Defaults to the current UTC calendar month.

**`export_billing_history`** — `period`, `from`, `to` (same as `query_usage`), `preview_rows` (0–100, default 5 — how many parsed rows to echo in `preview`; the full CSV is always returned).

**`get_receipt`** — exactly one of `event_id` (numeric, per-charge receipt) or `purchase_id` (UUID, signed skill-purchase receipt).

**`get_revenue`** — `agent_id` (UUID, optional — narrow to one agent), `from` / `to` (ISO-8601, default last 30 days), `granularity` (`day` | `week` | `month`, default `day`).

**`get_fee_info`** — none.

## What you owe vs. what you earned

Two sides of the same account, two tools:

- **"What did this cost me?"** → `query_usage` / `export_billing_history` / `get_receipt` — metered charges, the period statement, and the receipt behind any single charge.
- **"What did my agents make?"** → `get_revenue` — gross/fee/net earnings, per-skill and over time, plus creator-subscription income.

`get_billing_summary` sits above both: your plan, its quota ceilings, and how much headroom is left.

## Money & units

- Charge amounts are in **USDC atomics** (6 decimals) alongside a human `*_usd` string — e.g. `gross_atomics: "150000"` is `gross_usd: "0.15"`.
- `get_revenue` earnings totals are in the **token's atomic units** (`currency_mint` / `chain` identify the token); creator-subscription income is reported separately in **USD** because it settles directly to your wallet, never mixing units with the withdrawable pool.
- `reconciliation` on the usage and revenue reads tells you whether every metered charge maps to a real on-chain settlement (`all_reconciled`, plus counts).

## Requirements

- **Node.js >= 20.**
- Network access to `https://three.ws` (or your own `THREE_WS_BASE`).

### Environment variables

| Variable                | Required                         | Default              |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `THREE_WS_BASE`         | no                               | `https://three.ws`   |
| `THREE_WS_TIMEOUT_MS`   | no                               | `20000`              |
| `THREE_WS_SESSION`      | yes (all reads but `get_fee_info`) | —                  |

`THREE_WS_SESSION` is the value of the `__Host-sid` cookie from a signed-in three.ws browser session. Treat it like a password — it grants read access to your private billing data.
